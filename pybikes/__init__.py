"""PyBikes
PyBikes is a parsing library to extract bike sharing information from multiple
sources. It contains multiple classes to handle this sort of information,
and is not a class itself. The idea is to be able to call it like:

from pybikes import BicingShareSystem, BicingStation

bicing = new BicingShareSystem() <- Returns BicingShareSystem
print "%s: %s" % ("Bicing City is", bicing.meta.city)
stations = bicing.get_stations() <- Returns Array[BicingStation]
